The page must include the following elements.

    A heading starting with the "About" string (the actual case does not matter) and a few paragraphs (minimum 100 words in total) describing yourself, for instance, your current occupation and your general interest related to software and (or) computer science. Remember that both the repository source and the GitHub are public, so anyone can see what you write. If you feel uncomfortable in writing about yourself, write who you would like to be or just use a fictional character. In any case, do should not write any private information such as your student number, your date of birth, your address, and so on.

    An image of your choice. Is your responsibility to make sure that you comply with the image rights if you use a third-party image. (There are plenty of websites offering free images, such as pixabay and Pexels.) If you use a picture you took or an image you made, make sure to write down the usage rights; it is anyway recommended to avoid sharing any original image with commercial value. Again, remember that the repository and the related project page are public.

    A link to the diary-XXX.md page described below.

You are free to add other content (for instance, to practice with Markdown) as long as you have the three items above.
