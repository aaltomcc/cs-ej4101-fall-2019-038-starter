# ABOUT 

I am a curious individual, in an ever-changing world, on a journey of understanding what makes the world go round.

## UNDERSTANDING COMPUTERS

Computers are present in almost every aspect of our lives - in how we communicate with each other, how we shop, get medical care, navigate, work, etc...  But what are computers really, and how do they work? We often take them for granted, without stopping to think about the complex work that goes into making the programs and devices we use. 

The development of computers has progressed in leaps and bounds from where it started not that many years ago, when computers were the size of rooms. But we haven't seen it all yet; the development still continues and we will still be amazed by new innovations and programs - by things we never thought possible. 

Since computers are such a big part of our lives, I think we can all benefit from understanding computers better, and from getting a broader idea of how they work. And when we do, who knows, maybe _we_ will be the ones inventing something big one day.
