## LEARNED

* Git 
* DevOps                                                    
* Markdown                              
* Unit tests                  
* Merging commits  
* Technical debt  
* Continuous delivery
* etc...

Working in an IT company, in not the most technical of roles, I have heard of many of these concepts in various contexts, but never quite grasped the meaning of them or how they fit in the big picture. <br><br>
This course has taught me to understand a lot better what DevOps is all about, and how companies, like the one I work at, (can) use DevOps in the way they work, and terms such as _unit tests_, _technical debt_, _commits_, merging to master_, _Git_ make sense to me now.<br><br>
Probably because most terms were familiar from before, the puzzle pieces fell in place for me quite easily, and there was no particular part of the course that felt more challenging over the others. I liked how there was not only theory, but also practice, and Iâ€™m super glad to have learned to use Git and how to create a website with it. I, like many others, learn best by doing, so I like to try things out on my own to see how things work. Doing this website, was good fun in that sense. And the course materials, such as the interactive tutorials and the videos also made it easy to learn. I also now have a much better understanding of the different development processes, as well as the benefits that CI and particularly CD offer. <br><br>
It is amazing to think how far computer science has come in a few decades, and I look forward to seeing what the future will bring.
