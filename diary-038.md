## THIS COURSE

Computers affect our daily lives quite significantly but can in their complexity be quite misunderstood. But because computers are such big part of our lives, I think it is very important to have at least some knowledge about them and about different IT -concepts. Being a person who loves to understand the big picture and why things work the way they do, I am always curious to learn more and decided to take this course because I want to broaden my IT -knowledge, by better understanding the concept of DevOps. <br><br>
With the world becoming increasingly digitalized, and it becoming more and more evident, that computers are here to stay, it can also be seen as a good investment to broaden ones understanding as much as possible. Only the future will tell what the world will look like, how much further digitalization will go and what kind of IT -skills will be needed, but we’ve come too far to back down. It is difficult to imagine a future without computers, and therefore computer-skills are of essence. <br><br>
Signing up for this course, I expected to get a basic overview and gain a better understanding of what DevOps is. It is a term I hear quite often in my work, but a term I wasn’t all too familiar with. I wanted to change that, so I took this course… and I’m glad I did as I learned a lot. Not only did I learn about the concepts of DevOps, but I learned practical skills that I will be sure to utilize in in the future. <br><br>

### LEARNED

* Git 
* DevOps                                                    
* Markdown                              
* Unit tests                  
* Merging commits  
* Technical debt  
* Continuous delivery
* etc...

Working in an IT company, in not the most technical of roles, I have heard of many of these concepts in various contexts, but never quite grasped the meaning of them or how they fit in the big picture. <br><br>
This course has taught me to understand a lot better what DevOps is all about, and how companies, like the one I work at, (can) use DevOps in the way they work, and terms such as _unit tests_, _technical debt_, _commits_, merging to master_, _Git_ make sense to me now.<br><br>
Probably because most terms were familiar from before, the puzzle pieces fell in place for me quite easily, and there was no particular part of the course that felt more challenging over the others. I liked how there was not only theory, but also practice, and I’m super glad to have learned to use Git and how to create a website with it. I, like many others, learn best by doing, so I like to try things out on my own to see how things work. Doing this website, was good fun in that sense. And the course materials, such as the interactive tutorials and the videos also made it easy to learn. I also now have a much better understanding of the different development processes, as well as the benefits that CI and particularly CD offer. <br><br>
It is amazing to think how far computer science has come in a few decades, and I look forward to seeing what the future will bring.
