MORE TO COME 
The page must include the following elements.

    A heading containing the "this course" string followed by a few paragraphs or items in an unordered list describing why you decided to take this course and what you expected to learn. The related textual content should be between 250 and 500 words combined.

    A heading containing either the "learned" or "learning" string. The header should be followed by a few paragraphs or items in an unordered list explaining something new that you learned with the course and which was the most (or least) challenging part of it. The related textual content should be between 250 and 500 words combined.

Again, you are free to add other content as long as you have the two items above. Also make sure that the paragraphs or items immediately follow the headings they refer to.
